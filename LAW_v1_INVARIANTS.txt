LAW v1 — FORMAL INVARIANTS
Status: Enforced at compile + runtime
Scope: All compliant contracts

======================================
PANEL 0 — INTENT
======================================

I-0.1  Deployment MUST fail unless intent acknowledgment = true
I-0.2  Intent text hash MUST match canonical schema hash
I-0.3  Intent acknowledgment is non-replayable

======================================
PANEL 1 — IDENTITY
======================================

I-1.1  asset_name is immutable after deployment
I-1.2  ticker is immutable after deployment
I-1.3  ticker length ∈ [2,6] and charset ∈ A–Z
I-1.4  network MUST equal NEAR
I-1.5  No state transition may modify identity fields

======================================
PANEL 2 — SUPPLY LAW
======================================

I-2.1  Exactly one supply mode MUST be active
I-2.2  FIXED: total_supply == minted_supply_forever
I-2.3  FIXED: no mint function exists post-deploy
I-2.4  CAPPED: minted_supply ≤ max_supply at all times
I-2.5  MINTABLE: governance approval required for mint
I-2.6  No function may bypass supply guards

======================================
PANEL 3 — SAFETY SYSTEMS (BURN)
======================================

I-3.1  Burned tokens are permanently unrecoverable
I-3.2  Burn operations strictly decrease total_supply
I-3.3  AUTOMATED burn cannot be paused or reconfigured
I-3.4  burn_cap_percent is a hard upper bound
I-3.5  No mint + burn loop can increase supply

======================================
PANEL 4 — SAFETY SYSTEMS (TIME LOCK)
======================================

I-4.1  Time-lock schedule is deterministic
I-4.2  Unlock eligibility derives only from block time
I-4.3  No admin-triggered unlock paths exist
I-4.4  Claim window duration is fixed
I-4.5  Locked funds cannot be transferred early

======================================
PANEL 5 — DISTRIBUTION
======================================

I-5.1  Distribution percentages sum to exactly 100
I-5.2  Distribution is fixed at genesis
I-5.3  No post-deploy reallocation paths exist
I-5.4  Each allocation enforces its own cap
I-5.5  Overflow or underflow reverts execution

======================================
PANEL 6 — LAW TEXT
======================================

I-6.1  Law text is generated only from schema fields
I-6.2  Law text hash MUST match deployed hash
I-6.3  Law text is immutable post-deploy

======================================
PANEL 7 — FINAL CERTIFICATION
======================================

I-7.1  Full law text scroll is mandatory
I-7.2  Certification toggle must be true
I-7.3  Hold-to-confirm duration is enforced
I-7.4  Deployment is single-execution only

======================================
GLOBAL INVARIANTS
======================================

G-1  No privileged backdoors exist
G-2  No hidden state transitions exist
G-3  Deterministic inputs → deterministic outputs
G-4  Same law inputs always produce same WASM
G-5  All invariant violations MUST revert
