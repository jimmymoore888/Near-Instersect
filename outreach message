Hi — I’m reaching out because I’ve designed a mobile-first, modular crypto issuance framework that solves a real gap in today’s ecosystem.

The core idea is simple: users should be able to create crypto assets with real, built-in utility (burns, savings, timelocks, distributions, etc.) by selecting rules—not writing code—and do so from a phone.

I’ve completed the full architectural design (LAW schemas, modular utility system, invariants, and documentation). The execution layer is intentionally unimplemented, as this is best suited for a team with existing infrastructure.

This project is available for acquisition or strategic partnership.
Floor valuation: USD $5,000,000.00 depending on scope and terms.

If this aligns with your roadmap (wallets, infra, chains, launch platforms), I’m happy to share the repo and discuss next steps.
