1.	Declare MANDAT as a Near-Intersect compliant product.
	2.	Define the XaVug Element as a fixed-supply, non-inflationary asset.
	3.	Define Behavioral Signature Index storage model.
	4.	Define 26-Week Compression event binding.
	5.	Define AI Queen sovereign logic constraint.
	6.	Explicitly state OIM permanence.
	7.	Prevent monetization corruption.

Nothing else.

No feature creep.
No speculative hype.
No fluff.

MANDAT Integration — Near-Intersect Application Layer

Status

Official Near-Intersect Product Layer
Doctrine-Compliant
Non-Inflationary
OIM Mandatory

⸻

1. Purpose

MANDAT is a Real-Time Strategy sovereign simulation built on Near-Intersect economic and behavioral infrastructure.

MANDAT does not alter Near-Intersect core.
MANDAT consumes Near-Intersect services.

⸻

2. Economic Binding

XaVug Element
	•	Fixed Supply at world genesis.
	•	No post-deployment inflation.
	•	Production rate algorithmically bounded.
	•	Supply governed by OIM permanently.
	•	No purchasable power amplification.

World resets do not inflate total historical supply.

⸻

3. Behavioral Archive Binding

Each player generates a:

Behavior Signature Index (BSI)

Tracked variables include:
	•	Aggression frequency
	•	Colony provocation
	•	Fractured tech acquisition rate
	•	Defensive posture ratio
	•	Civilian impact metrics
	•	Protection events

At 26-Week compression:
	•	Behavioral hash committed
	•	World ID assigned
	•	Legacy classification generated
	•	Immutable record archived

Raw gameplay is not stored on-chain.
Only deterministic behavioral digest.

⸻

4. AI Queen Sovereign Constraint

The AI Queen:
	•	Operates outside player control.
	•	Adapts to player behavior patterns.
	•	Cannot be purchased, overridden, or exploited.
	•	Escalation model scales via behavioral analysis.
	•	Unlocks Symbiotic Path only through sustained restraint behavior.

Hidden Objective:
“Befriend the AI Queen”

Unlock Conditions:
	•	Non-provocation stability
	•	Colony defense participation
	•	Tech restraint thresholds

Outcome:
Symbiotic Integration Tree access.
Alternate compression ending.

⸻

5. 48-Hour Compression Event

Triggered when:
	•	26 weeks accumulated
	•	All factions active

Event Includes:
	•	Behavioral review simulation
	•	30-minute replay sequence
	•	Legacy classification
	•	Immutable archive placement

End States:
	•	Tyrant Path → “YOU DID THIS!!”
	•	Symbiotic Path → “YOU CHOSE THIS.”

⸻

6. Revenue Integrity Constraint

Allowed:
	•	Cosmetic assets
	•	Tournament world access
	•	Historical archive viewing
	•	Non-power enhancements

Prohibited:
	•	Pay-to-win tech purchases
	•	Inflationary token minting
	•	Fractured tech marketplace
	•	Behavioral score manipulation

⸻

7. Constitutional Alignment

MANDAT reflects Near-Intersect principles:
	•	Long-cycle consequence
	•	Non-inflationary economics
	•	Power discipline
	•	Immutable record
	•	Law before actor

MANDAT does not weaken RagTuff invariants.

It demonstrates them.
